                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                        (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, 
                        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                        control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for
                        a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for 
                        example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
                                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
                                For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place 
                                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
                                clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                                relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                                extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide 
                                continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, 
                                or perform file manipulations on a server.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad 
                        and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

                            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try 
                                one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

                    <p>
                        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
                        The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), 
                        or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). 
                        Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters 
                        "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
                        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. 
                        Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                <div class="section-doc">
                    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        <p>With the keyword var. For example,
                            <code>var x = 42.</code>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. 
                        You shouldn't use this variant.
                        <p>With the keyword let. For example,
                            <code>let y = 13.</code>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        <p>
                            With the keyword var. For example,
                            <code>var x = 42.</code>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. 
                        See Variable scope below.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section-doc">
                    <p>
                        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
                        The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable 
                        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign 
                        and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                    </p>
                    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                    <p>
                        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while 
                        the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope 
                        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed 
                        to represent a variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or 
                        variable in the same scope. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement 
                        is executed without problems.
                    </p>
                    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

                <div class="section-doc">
                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Six data types that are primitives:

                                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript 
                                        is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other 
                                        variant.
                                    </li>

                    <p>
                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global 
                        variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. 
                        When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, 
                        because it is available only within that function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; 
                        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function 
                        (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following 
                        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) 
                        within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                    </code>
                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                    <code>
                        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                        defined
                    </code>

                   <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. 
                    In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and 
                    access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window 
                    or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or 
                    frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared 
                    in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as 
                    parent.phoneNumber.
